# ComIT Final Project

The final project is required to complete the `MERN` stack course. It is intended to give you an
opportunity to create a full featured app. The end goal is to add an item to your personal development portfolio that showcases your skills as
a developer, and to provide the ComIT instructors and coordinators an example of your work so they may
provide feedback on how to further improve your project.

The final project is open ended and you are free to use whatever open source libraries or frameworks you
think are appropriate for the app you have decided to create. Although you are free to decide what
features your finished product will include, there are some baseline requirements:

1. Your app must have a `frontend` - React
2. Your app must have a `backend` - `Express` and `MongoDB`
3. It is also strongly suggested that your application uses a `database` to save and load data.

In order to guide you in developing your application the project can be divided into a set of milestones.

## üöÄ Milestone 1 - Deadline March 05, 2025

The first milestone is to decide what you want to build and to "break ground" on your project. To complete
this milestone you should complete the following:

1. **_Decide_** what project to build. This is likely the most difficult step, so don't feel to much pressure to
   stick to you first idea.

> [!TIP]
> Talk to TAs or your instructor if your are unsure.

2. **_Create_** a profile in an online version control platform. `GitHub` is the most popular example, however
   there are alternatives such as `Gitlab`, `BitBucket`, or `Codeberg`.
3. **_Create_** a new public repo with a unique title related to what your `app` will do.

4. **_Add_** a "README" `markdown` file to the root of your project. Provide a short summary of what your
   application will do. Don't write more that a paragraph, a few lines is fine.

- What is a [README](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)

- Here's [markdown-basic-syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

- Check out [this](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template) project `readme` template to give you an idea

- Also check out [this awesome readme starter template](./readme-template.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Your project `readme` file does not have to have all sections completed. We are going to do so overtime and in each milestone.

6. **Submit** at least 5 drafts of your project (draw only). You can use pen and paper and take pictures of it.

7. **_Share_** your project with the class! We will create a channel dedicated to project discussions. Post
   there with a link to your project and write in your message that you have finished the first milestone.

## üìÑ Milestone 2 - Deadline March 14, 2022

The second milestone is to perform some initial design work and to initialize your development
environment. At this point you should have started making progress on your application (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap) and made some early design decisions,
but you are not required to have done much work. To complete this milestone you should do the following:

1. **Expand** on your initial `README` file and document the specifics of your application. Include a section
   of documentation where you summarize what framework(s) or libraries you have decided to develop your
   application with.
2. **Include a section** in your documentation on how to run your application. This will depend on what
   frameworks/libraries you have chosen to work with (bare-bones HTML and CSS with some bootstrap spread around to help you out is awesome too üôÇ) but the goal is that anyone that clones your repository
   should follow your instructions and be able to start your application.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Although your app doesn't need to fully work at this point(a blank screen or default web page is fine when someone `git clone`), you should have some working code in a `develop` branch or `feature` branch, or something similar. Remember to use `git` workflow (branch out, commit, merge, ...) to develop your app incrementally.

3. **Include** a simple wireframe of what your application might look like (1 - 3 pages).

- You can use a simple tool like [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to build it.

4. **Share** your progress with the group in Slack. Write a message declaring that you have finished the
   second Milestone and include a link to the project again for easy access.

## üìä Milestone 3 - Deadline March 21, 2025

This Milestone is a little more open ended and will depend on how much work you have done, and how
much you have planned. The goal here is to demonstrate that development is underway and that you have
a roadmap on what you would like to accomplish with your project. To complete this milestone you should
do the following:

1. **Add** to your README file a project roadmap. This is just a simple list of features that you would like
   to include in your application. You are not obligated to complete all of these, think of it as a wishlist if
   you had infinite time to complete the project.
2. In your roadmap, **indicate** which of the features have been completed. To finish this milestone, at
   least one feature should be done.
3. **Be sure to update** your documentation so the `README` description and instructions on how to run
   your software are still accurate.
4. **Update** the class on your progress! Update the project channel with your latest feature update! As
   usual please include a link to your project page for easy access from your post.

## üìÅ Milestone 4 - Deadline April 08, 2025

At this point you should have finished all of the features you think you will be able to finish before the end of the course. This does not mean you need
to be done all of the features in your roadmap. This is simply a point in your project development where
you stop adding new things and start polishing what you have. To complete this milestone do the following:

1. **Update** your `README` file as needed. Ensure the roadmap and other documentation is up to date.

2. You have designed your database and you can provide some images on the schema of your data

![database designed](./resources/designed.jpg)

3. **Share** with the group your progress and provide a short summary of what you plan to present. This is
   a very short message, only a few lines. For example if you had developed an e-commerce app you
   could say "Hello everyone, I have completed milestone 4. On the day of the presentation I will
   demonstrate how you can use my application to register an account, login, and add items to your
   cart."

## üìÉ Milestone 5 - Deadline April 11, 2025

This milestones ensures you have a database created and `backend` environment prepared (API).

1. **Update** your `README` file as needed. Ensure the roadmap and other documentation is up to date.

2. **Share** with the group your progress and provide a short summary of the challenges you have had setting up your `backend` (database, endpoints, etc.) and what you did to overcome them.

## üòé Milestone 6 - Deadline April 15, 2025

Show at least 5 screens implemented (it does not include login page)

## üó£Ô∏è Project Presentations

At the end of the term everyone will be given an opportunity to present their work to the rest of the class.
This is mandatory if you want to complete the course.

You will be given a short window of time (around 5 minutes) to demonstrate how your application works
and what features you have implemented. You can also take this time to discuss what features you may
want to add in the future.

This is a very casual presentation. The only requirement is that you arrive on time and demonstrate that
you have a working application. The goal here is to showcase what you have learned, and for Pablo and the
course instructors to provide constructive feedback on how to improve what you have.
